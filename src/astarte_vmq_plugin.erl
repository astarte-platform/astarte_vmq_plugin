    % application crashes, VerneMQ comes down with it (and gets restarted by
    % K8s).
    % To do so, we need to define this erlang wrapper since right now VerneMQ
    % assumes the custom start function is contained in a module with the same
    % name as the application, which can't be an Elixir module due to naming
    % constraints.
